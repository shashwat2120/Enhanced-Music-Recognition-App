## üáÆüá≥ Local Database for Indian Songs

You can build your own local fingerprint database for Indian (or any) songs, enabling offline recognition for tracks not found in Shazam's database.

### **A. Prepare Your Song Files**
- Collect Indian songs in WAV or MP3 format and place them in a folder, e.g., `indian_songs/`.

### **B. Build the Local Database**
1. Create a file named `build_local_db.py` with the following content:
   ```python
   import os
   import librosa
   import pickle
   from audio_fingerprint import AudioFingerprinter

   SONG_FOLDER = "indian_songs"
   DB_FILE = "indian_fingerprint_db.pkl"

   fingerprinter = AudioFingerprinter()

   for filename in os.listdir(SONG_FOLDER):
       if filename.endswith(".mp3") or filename.endswith(".wav"):
           song_path = os.path.join(SONG_FOLDER, filename)
           print(f"Processing {filename}...")
           audio_data, sr = librosa.load(song_path, sr=None)
           fingerprinter.add_song(filename, audio_data, sr)

   with open(DB_FILE, "wb") as f:
       pickle.dump(fingerprinter.database, f)

   print(f"Database saved to {DB_FILE}")
   ```
2. Place your Indian songs in the `indian_songs/` folder.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python build_local_db.py
   ```
4. This will create `indian_fingerprint_db.pkl` in your project directory.

### **C. Use the Local Database in the App**
1. Load the database in your app:
   ```python
   import pickle
   from audio_fingerprint import AudioFingerprinter

   with open("indian_fingerprint_db.pkl", "rb") as f:
       db = pickle.load(f)

   fingerprinter = AudioFingerprinter()
   fingerprinter.database = db

   # To recognize a song:
   match, score = fingerprinter.recognize_song(audio_data, sr)
   if match:
       st.success(f"Local DB Match: {match} (score: {score})")
   else:
       st.info("No match found in local database.")
   ```
2. Integrate this check alongside the Shazam recognition in your Streamlit app for best results.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for Shazam integration
- Microphone access for recording feature
- Sufficient disk space for audio processing
- Modern web browser for Streamlit interface

## üîß Dependencies

- streamlit==1.28.0
- librosa==0.10.1
- numpy==1.24.3
- pydub==0.25.1
- scipy==1.11.3

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

1. **Microphone Access Issues**
   - Ensure your microphone is properly connected
   - Check system permissions for microphone access
   - Try restarting the application

2. **Recognition Failures**
   - Verify internet connection for Shazam integration
   - Check audio quality and background noise
   - Ensure audio file format is supported (WAV/MP3)
   - For local DB, ensure your song is in the database

3. **Installation Problems**
